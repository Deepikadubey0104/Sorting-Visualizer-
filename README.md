# Sorting-Visualizer-


With my interest in c++ in mind, I decided to write a few sorting algorithms as a way to practice using the language without doing anything too extensive. What resulted was a series of dull challenges which really tells you nothing about me as a programmer and if I can do anything. However, I recalled watching these youtube videos from when I was freshman first learning the algorithms and decided visualizing my implementations may be a way to add some spice to what was otherwise a very dull set of implementations.
